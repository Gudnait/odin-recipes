    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>The "fake rabbit," is a beloved Bolivian dish 
        that belies its name. This hearty meal features 
        thin, breaded beef cutlets, often seasoned with 
        aji amarillo, a bright yellow chili pepper. 
        The cutlets are pan-fried to a golden brown 
        and then simmered in a rich, flavorful sauce. 
        The name "fake rabbit" likely stems from 
        the cutlets' resemblance to rabbit meat, 
        but the taste is entirely its own, 
        offering a satisfying blend of savory 
        and slightly spicy flavors.</p>
